# FlowEstimator
Static estimator for flow velocities in Domestic Heat Networks

The goal is to estimate, without the need for dynamic simulations, if the pipes in a DHC network might exceed the maximum allowed flow velocity.

In General, the flow velocity inside a pipe is determined by the following equations:
